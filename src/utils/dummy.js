Throughout this we'll be talking about the main comics that inspired it along with what stories we've heard theyre adapting.\n\nIt's february 4th which is an F and a 4 and though there's been trailers shown privately at events, this adds a lot in. That was put together really quickly and was mainly made up from costume tests, special effects reels and what theyd managed to film so far.\n\nHowever we will also be going over what happened in that one if you havent seen it and this is kind of our mega breakdown about everything you need to know.\n\nSo come with us as we explain first steps first look and lets get into the trailer.\n\n-\n\nNow we begin with an hour long countdown which I rushed home for and the wife wasn't happy BUT after that we get into the trailer.\n\nAnd by that I mean another live event.\n\nBUT AFTER THAT we get into the trailer.\n\nBeginning with a tour of the baxter building we watch Reed and Sue guiding someone about the house.\n\nIts very akin to the hickman run in which theyd often give tours. This too featured in Civil War and its pretty much just the family showing the world who they are.\n\nTheyre pretty much celebrities so its kind of like a 1960s reality tv thing. Shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio it also feels like a classic tv show.\n\nNow the films obviously gonna have a very heavy 60s retro futuristic aesthetic.\n\nThe movies gonna be set in 1963 but I do feel like theyll be pulled into the modern day...or maybe across the multiverse.\n\nHowever,¬†If youve read the original run of the comics it all feels really inline with that. Its kind of like a Jetsons thing set in the past where they have really high tech things but also a sixties style to it.",

This today is my scientific discovery to see if I can take a sword wielding roman legion and make them more powerful than a modern age tank. The tank has a combat strength of 65 which is incredibly high in comparison to the romans 25. A tank can easily 1 hit a roman because well its a tank.

The player uses various units, representing military and civilian units, to explore the map, grow their civilization through additional cities, culture, and technology, gather resources from the geography around their settlements, and defeat threats from foreign civilizations also attempting to grow.

          "Hi everyone,\n\nI just wanted to share that Andrew was in a major car accident on Friday night. He suffered a severe traumatic brain injury and immediately underwent brain surgery upon arrival at the ER. He is currently in the intensive care unit fighting for his life. This community has been the most enormous blessing to us both this past year. You are all more than just his subscribers, you are people who recognize just how special he is and show up to honor that week after week with your time and kind words. I feel confident that he would want you all to know this news. Please be praying for him and sending all of the good thoughts. If you care to follow along and receive health updates, feel free to access that at the link below:\n\nhttps://www.caringbridge.org/site/5fcb666d-e0b8-11ef-abc2-a31fd9bc4383\n\nMuch love to you all. Thank you for being here.\n\nEvelyn",

          description:
            "Hi everyone,\n\nI just wanted to share that Andrew was in a major car accident on Friday night. He suffered a severe traumatic brain injury and immediately underwent brain surgery upon arrival at the ER. He is currently in the intensive care unit fighting for his life. This community has been the most enormous blessing to us both this past year. You are all more than just his subscribers, you are people who recognize just how special he is and show up to honor that week after week with your time and kind words. I feel confident that he would want you all to know this news. Please be praying for him and sending all of the good thoughts. If you care to follow along and receive health updates, feel free to access that at the link below:\n\nhttps://www.caringbridge.org/site/5fcb666d-e0b8-11ef-abc2-a31fd9bc4383\n\nMuch love to you all. Thank you for being here.\n\nEvelyn",
